            <h3>ChatGPT: Creator or Terminator? How a Movie Pushed Me to Learn AI</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> August 11, 2024</p>
            <p>Every once in a while, you watch a movie that changes the way you think about the world—and for me, that movie was <strong>ChatGPT: Creator or Terminator?</strong>. As someone already curious about AI, this film felt like a wake-up call. It wasn’t just about the futuristic technology we see on the screen; it was about the real-life potential of AI and what we can do with it right now.</p>
            <p>The movie explored the two opposing sides of AI: is it a tool to help humanity flourish, or could it become the very thing that puts us at risk?

            <p>After watching, I knew I wanted to be on the side of AI as a creator. I started learning more about AI systems like ChatGPT and even enrolled in courses on AI Python coding to get a better grasp of the technology.</p>
