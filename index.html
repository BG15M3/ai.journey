    <h3>Streamlining Inventory with AI: How I Automated Returns Calculations</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 1, 2024</p>
    <p>Managing inventory efficiently is key to success in any delivery business. But what if I told you thereâ€™s a way to streamline that process, saving you hours of manual work? Thatâ€™s exactly what I discovered while building my returns calculation spreadsheetâ€”an automated solution that leverages AI concepts to simplify the chaos.</p>

    <h4>The Problem: Manual Returns Calculations</h4>
    <p>As a delivery driver, Iâ€™m constantly juggling multiple tasks, from ensuring timely deliveries to keeping track of returns. Returns are a normal part of the job, but managing them manually can be a logistical headache. I needed a way to simplify this processâ€”something that would automatically calculate returns, ensuring I had accurate stock data at a glance.</p>

    <h4>The Solution: Creating an Automated Spreadsheet</h4>
    <p>The idea hit me after diving into AI and data analysis tools like Google Sheets, SQL, and Tableau. With some inspiration from my AI studies, I realized I could build an automated returns calculation spreadsheet to remove the guesswork. It wasnâ€™t AI in the traditional sense of deep learning models or chatbots, but the idea of automating repetitive tasks is a foundational concept in AI, and thatâ€™s exactly what I aimed to achieve here.</p>

    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <p>The returns calculation spreadsheet I built automatically processes returns data, subtracting it from the stock and giving me a net stock total in real-time. This simple system has drastically reduced errors and manual work. Now, I can focus on more important tasks, confident that my inventory numbers are accurate.</p>

    <p>I cleaned up the header rows, ensured the fields were clear, and optimized the layout for easy updates. The sheet now tracks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Product stock levels</li>
        <li>Returned items</li>
        <li>Net stock (after returns)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Benefits of Automation: Less Time, Fewer Errors</h4>
    <p>Before building this sheet, Iâ€™d spend a good chunk of my day manually calculating returns and adjusting stock levels. Now, with everything automated, itâ€™s a matter of entering the data, and the rest is handled for me. The time saved is invaluable, and the accuracy means no more second-guessing or cross-checking my numbers.</p>

    <p>Plus, this is just the beginning. With this success, Iâ€™m looking to implement more automation in my workflowâ€”eventually integrating more AI-based solutions into other aspects of my job.</p>

    <h4>Looking Forward: Combining AI with Everyday Solutions</h4>
    <p>The returns calculation spreadsheet may seem simple, but itâ€™s a powerful example of how AI-inspired thinking can make a tangible difference in day-to-day operations. Itâ€™s not just about complex AI algorithmsâ€”itâ€™s about making your life easier by letting technology handle the repetitive tasks.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m excited to continue improving this system and explore more AI tools that can integrate with my existing workflow. From stock management to delivery scheduling, the possibilities are endless.</p>

    <p><strong>If youâ€™re interested in learning how you can use AI and automation in your own work, stay tuned as I continue to share my AI journey. And if you want to see how my returns calculation system works, Iâ€™ll be breaking it down step by step in future posts.</strong></p>

    <h3>Harnessing AI: Building Drive Scan and CSV Upload Python Scripts</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 1, 2024</p>
    <p>As I dive deeper into my AI and Python journey, I've realized the value of automating tasks that were once tedious. One recent project I worked on was creating a Python script that scans my disk drives and generates CSV files with details of the contents. I then built another script to upload those CSVs into SQL Server, making file management and data tracking more efficient.</p>
    
    <h4>The Challenge: Tracking Disk Drive Contents</h4>
    <p>Managing file inventories across multiple disk drives can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to keeping track of whatâ€™s stored where. I needed a solution that would automate this process, allowing me to quickly generate an up-to-date file inventory without manually checking through all the directories.</p>

    <h4>Developing the Drive Scan and CSV Creation Script</h4>
    <p>I turned to Python to automate this task. Using the <code>os</code> and <code>csv</code> libraries, I wrote a script that scans specified drives, gathers file information, and saves the details into a CSV file. This gave me an easily accessible record of all the files on a given drive.</p>

    <pre><code>
import os
import csv

def scan_drive_and_create_csv(directory, output_csv):
    with open(output_csv, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(["File Path", "File Name"])

        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
            for file_name in files:
                writer.writerow([os.path.join(root, file_name), file_name])

    print(f"CSV created: {output_csv}")

# Example usage
directory_to_scan = '/path/to/your/directory'
output_csv_file = 'drive_contents.csv'
scan_drive_and_create_csv(directory_to_scan, output_csv_file)
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Uploading the CSVs to SQL Server</h4>
    <p>Once the CSV files are generated, the next step is to upload them to SQL Server. This enables centralized storage and easy access to the data. Using the <code>pandas</code> and <code>pyodbc</code> libraries, I created a script to automate the CSV-to-database upload process.</p>

    <pre><code>
import pandas as pd
import pyodbc

def upload_csv_to_sql_server(csv_file, connection_string):
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    with pyodbc.connect(connection_string) as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        for index, row in df.iterrows():
            cursor.execute(
                "INSERT INTO your_table_name (file_path, file_name) VALUES (?, ?)",
                row['File Path'], row['File Name']
            )
        conn.commit()
    print(f"{csv_file} uploaded successfully!")

# Example usage
connection_string = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=your_server;Database=your_database;UID=your_username;PWD=your_password;"
upload_csv_to_sql_server(output_csv_file, connection_string)
    </code></pre>

    <h4>The Results: Streamlined File Management</h4>
    <p>By automating the drive scanning, CSV creation, and upload processes, Iâ€™ve significantly reduced the time and effort needed to track my file inventories. With just a few scripts, I can now generate CSV reports of my disk drives and upload them to SQL Server for safekeeping.</p>

    <h4>Looking Ahead: Exploring More Automation</h4>
    <p>This project has been a great example of how Python can simplify complex tasks. Moving forward, Iâ€™m excited to explore more ways to leverage AI and automation in my workflow, enhancing productivity and efficiency even further.</p>

    <p><strong>Stay tuned for more insights and updates as I continue to explore AI and Python in my projects!</strong></p>

    <h2>Creating JavaScript for PARS Spreadsheet Data Entry</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In this entry, Iâ€™ll share my experience creating a JavaScript function to manage data entry for the PARS spreadsheet. This function streamlines the process by automatically hiding and showing specific columns based on user selections in the "Store" column. This approach enhances usability and keeps the spreadsheet organized.</p>
    
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The main objective was to create a dynamic data entry system in Google Sheets that allows users to select a store name and automatically reveals the relevant data columns. This improves the efficiency of data management and ensures users only see the information they need.</p>
    
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    
    <h4>1. Setting Up the Trigger:</h4>
    <p>The function utilizes the <code>onEdit(e)</code> trigger to listen for changes in the spreadsheet. This trigger activates whenever a user edits the spreadsheet, allowing us to respond accordingly.</p>
    <pre><code>function onEdit(e) {
    var sheet = e.source.getActiveSheet();
    var range = e.range;

    // Check if the edit was made in the "Store" column (Column B)
    if (range.getColumn() == 2 && range.getRow() > 1) {
        var store = range.getValue().toString().trim();</code></pre>
    
    <h4>2. Hiding and Showing Columns:</h4>
    <p>The function first hides all columns to maintain a clean view. Then, it reveals specific columns based on the selected store. This is achieved through a series of conditional statements that check the store name and show the appropriate columns.</p>
    <pre><code>// Hide all columns first
    sheet.hideColumns(1, sheet.getLastColumn());

    // Show specific columns based on the store selected
    if (store == 'AFC') {
        var columnsToShow = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 31, 32, 33, 34, 51, 52, 53, 54];
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; columnsToShow.length; i++) {
            sheet.showColumns(columnsToShow[i]);
        }
    } 
    // Additional else if statements for other stores...</code></pre>
    
    <h4>3. Adding New Stores:</h4>
    <p>As I added more stores, I continued the pattern of defining specific columns for each store. For example, for "M Plaza," I included columns 63 to 66.</p>
    <pre><code>} else if (store == 'M Plaza') {
        var columnsToShowMPlaza = [1, 2, 63, 64, 65, 66];
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; columnsToShowMPlaza.length; i++) {
            sheet.showColumns(columnsToShowMPlaza[i]);
        }
    }</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Creating this JavaScript function for the PARS spreadsheet has significantly improved data entry efficiency. Users can now easily navigate the spreadsheet, seeing only the columns relevant to their selected store. This project not only enhances usability but also showcases the power of Google Apps Script in automating tasks within Google Sheets.</p>
    
    <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
    <p>Looking ahead, I plan to add more functionality, such as validating user input and integrating additional features to further streamline data entry. I am excited to see how these improvements will enhance the user experience.</p>

    <h2>How I Automated Randomized Photo Slideshows with a Simple Script</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to take control of your photo collection and make viewing them more interesting? Thatâ€™s exactly what I set out to do when I automated the process of renaming my images and creating a randomized slideshow. What started as a simple organizational task turned into a fun project that brought my photos to life in unexpected ways.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Organizing the Photos</h3>
    <p>It all started with a folder I created on my PC called <strong>rename_photos</strong>. I had a collection of images, and while flipping through them manually was fine, I wanted to automate the process and add some randomness. The goal was to view these images as a slideshow but with a twist: seeing them in a different order every time.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Writing the Script to Rename Files</h3>
    <p>I knew that randomizing the image order was going to require renaming the files in the folder. So, I wrote a Python script to shuffle the image files and rename them in a new sequence every time the script ran. This way, the slideshow wouldnâ€™t just be in the same order, but it would surprise me each time. Here's the script I used:</p>
    <pre>
import os
import random

def rename_photos(directory):
    files = os.listdir(directory)
    random.shuffle(files)
    
    for i, file in enumerate(files):
        ext = os.path.splitext(file)[1]  # Get the file extension
        new_name = f"photo_{i + 1}{ext}"
        os.rename(os.path.join(directory, file), os.path.join(directory, new_name))

# Specify the folder path
folder_path = 'rename_photos'
rename_photos(folder_path)
    </pre>
    <p>This script was a game changer! It shuffled the file names and renamed them in the format <strong>photo_1.jpg</strong>, <strong>photo_2.jpg</strong>, and so on. The randomness came from using Pythonâ€™s <strong>random.shuffle()</strong> function, which means the photos now show up in different orders each time I run the script.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Running the Slideshow</h3>
    <p>After the photos were renamed, it was time to enjoy the slideshow. Running it was easy and added a fresh layer of excitement each time I went through my images:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, I opened the <strong>rename_photos</strong> folder in File Explorer.</li>
        <li>Then, I selected all the images by pressing <strong>Ctrl + A</strong>.</li>
        <li>Right-clicking one of the images, I chose <strong>Open with &gt; Photos</strong>.</li>
        <li>Finally, I hit <strong>F5</strong> in the Photos app, and voilaâ€”an instant slideshow with images displayed in a new order every time!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why This Project Was Fun</h3>
    <p>What I loved about this little automation project was that it allowed me to rediscover my photo collection in an entirely new way. The randomness brought back memories I hadn't seen in a while, and the element of surprise kept me entertained. Plus, it was satisfying to see how a simple script could enhance my experience of something as simple as a slideshow.</p>

    <h3>Whatâ€™s Next?</h3>
    <p>This experiment sparked more ideas for how I can automate or enhance everyday tasks, especially in terms of AI and coding. Iâ€™m already working on more projects that involve AI-driven automation, so stay tuned if youâ€™re interested in seeing where this journey takes me!</p>
