    <h3>ChatGPT: Creator or Terminator? How a Movie Pushed Me to Learn AI</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> August 11, 2024</p>
    <p>Every once in a while, you watch a movie that changes the way you think about the worldâ€”and for me, that movie was <strong>ChatGPT: Creator or Terminator?</strong>. As someone already curious about AI, this film felt like a wake-up call. It wasnâ€™t just about the futuristic technology we see on the screen; it was about the real-life potential of AI and what we can do with it right now.</p>
    <p>The movie explored the two opposing sides of AI: is it a tool to help humanity flourish, or could it become the very thing that puts us at risk? While the film leaned into some of the more dramatic, dystopian visions, it also highlighted the immense possibilities AI offers. It was this duality that struck meâ€”<strong>AI can be as much a creator as it could be a destroyer</strong>, and how we use it is what matters most.</p>
    <p>After watching, I knew I wanted to be on the side of AI as a creator. I started learning more about AI systems like ChatGPT and even enrolled in courses on AI Python coding to get a better grasp of how it all works. <strong>Why leave the future of AI to chance when I can be part of shaping it?</strong> The movie wasnâ€™t just entertainment; it became a turning point for me to dive deeper into AI technology, prompting, and coding.</p>
    <p>This journey has made me realize that AI isnâ€™t just a distant idea from sci-fiâ€”itâ€™s happening now. Whether we harness it for good or let it spiral out of control depends on people like usâ€”curious minds ready to understand and influence this powerful technology. Watching the movie motivated me to take that leap, and now Iâ€™m more excited than ever to see where this AI adventure takes me.</p>

    <h3>Unlocking the 8-Bit Brain: My Journey Into AI and Python</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> August 19, 2024</p>
    <p>Today marks a significant milestone in my AI learning journeyâ€”Iâ€™ve officially completed <strong>AI Python for Beginners: Basics of AI Python Coding</strong>! ðŸŽ‰ As someone fascinated by technology and eager to understand the future of AI, this course felt like the perfect starting point.</p>
    <p>One of the most interesting aspects of this course was how <strong>I was learning directly from an AI chatbot</strong>. Not only did I get hands-on experience running Python code, but I also had the incredible opportunity to <strong>ask questions to a chatbot that taught me Python</strong>. Whenever I hit a roadblock or made a mistake, I simply turned to the chatbot, and it would correct my code and explain why. This interactive learning style felt like having a personal tutor available at all timesâ€”making the learning process smooth and engaging.</p>
    <p>As I navigated through Pythonâ€™s syntax, machine learning concepts, and data handling, I realized just how powerful and versatile AI is. Pythonâ€™s simplicity made it easy to understand, while its applications in AI opened up a whole new world of possibilities. Whether itâ€™s crafting a perfect prompt for an AI assistant or diving deeper into neural networks, itâ€™s clear that <strong>AI is more than just a trend</strong>â€”itâ€™s the future.</p>
    <p>This milestone is just the beginning. With Python in my toolkit and AI as my focus, Iâ€™m excited to push forward, build real-world projects, and continue expanding my knowledge. If this course taught me one thing, itâ€™s that the possibilities are endless when you combine coding and AI. Now, Iâ€™m ready to apply these skills, explore more advanced topics, and maybe even develop some AI-powered tools of my own.</p>
    <p><strong>To anyone curious about AIâ€”donâ€™t hesitate!</strong> Jump in, start coding, and letâ€™s shape the future together. ðŸš€</p>

        <h3>My Introduction to AI Prompt Engineering</h3>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 16, 2024</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered how to get more from AI, beyond just basic commands? I recently discovered that the secret lies in crafting better prompts!</p>
        <p>I stumbled upon a TikTok by <strong>Sabrina Romanov</strong>, who explained how AI responds more effectively when you give it well-thought-out prompts. Already curious about AI, this immediately grabbed my attention. What really stood out, though, was when she mentioned the emerging role of <strong>Prompt Engineers</strong>â€”people who specialize in mastering the language of AI.</p>
        <p>Sabrina recommended a course called <strong>"Beginners: Basics of AI Python Coding"</strong>, so I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be a comprehensive introduction to AI that exceeded my expectations. The course taught me key terminology and how to interact with AI using Python and chatbots. One major takeaway was how even small adjustments to a prompt can significantly change the AI's response. This helped me see how powerful prompt engineering can be.</p>
        <p>Now, Iâ€™m more excited than ever to continue my journey toward becoming a prompt engineer. I'll be sharing more about the tools Iâ€™m using and my ongoing progress, so stay tuned!</p>

    <h3>Streamlining Inventory with AI: How I Automated Returns Calculations</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 1, 2024</p>
    <p>Managing inventory efficiently is key to success in any delivery business. But what if I told you thereâ€™s a way to streamline that process, saving you hours of manual work? Thatâ€™s exactly what I discovered while building my returns calculation spreadsheetâ€”an automated solution that leverages AI concepts to simplify the chaos.</p>

    <h4>The Problem: Manual Returns Calculations</h4>
    <p>As a delivery driver, Iâ€™m constantly juggling multiple tasks, from ensuring timely deliveries to keeping track of returns. Returns are a normal part of the job, but managing them manually can be a logistical headache. I needed a way to simplify this processâ€”something that would automatically calculate returns, ensuring I had accurate stock data at a glance.</p>

    <h4>The Solution: Creating an Automated Spreadsheet</h4>
    <p>The idea hit me after diving into AI and data analysis tools like Google Sheets, SQL, and Tableau. With some inspiration from my AI studies, I realized I could build an automated returns calculation spreadsheet to remove the guesswork. It wasnâ€™t AI in the traditional sense of deep learning models or chatbots, but the idea of automating repetitive tasks is a foundational concept in AI, and thatâ€™s exactly what I aimed to achieve here.</p>

    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <p>The returns calculation spreadsheet I built automatically processes returns data, subtracting it from the stock and giving me a net stock total in real-time. This simple system has drastically reduced errors and manual work. Now, I can focus on more important tasks, confident that my inventory numbers are accurate.</p>

    <p>I cleaned up the header rows, ensured the fields were clear, and optimized the layout for easy updates. The sheet now tracks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Product stock levels</li>
        <li>Returned items</li>
        <li>Net stock (after returns)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Benefits of Automation: Less Time, Fewer Errors</h4>
    <p>Before building this sheet, Iâ€™d spend a good chunk of my day manually calculating returns and adjusting stock levels. Now, with everything automated, itâ€™s a matter of entering the data, and the rest is handled for me. The time saved is invaluable, and the accuracy means no more second-guessing or cross-checking my numbers.</p>

    <p>Plus, this is just the beginning. With this success, Iâ€™m looking to implement more automation in my workflowâ€”eventually integrating more AI-based solutions into other aspects of my job.</p>

    <h4>Looking Forward: Combining AI with Everyday Solutions</h4>
    <p>The returns calculation spreadsheet may seem simple, but itâ€™s a powerful example of how AI-inspired thinking can make a tangible difference in day-to-day operations. Itâ€™s not just about complex AI algorithmsâ€”itâ€™s about making your life easier by letting technology handle the repetitive tasks.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m excited to continue improving this system and explore more AI tools that can integrate with my existing workflow. From stock management to delivery scheduling, the possibilities are endless.</p>

    <p><strong>If youâ€™re interested in learning how you can use AI and automation in your own work, stay tuned as I continue to share my AI journey. And if you want to see how my returns calculation system works, Iâ€™ll be breaking it down step by step in future posts.</strong></p>
